## Hate_speech_analysis
This is a project on twitter sentiment analysis, specifically "hateful" and "offensive" emotions.
We have mainly classified data into two classes: "none" and "offense" (as a joke to "none" taken!!)

It has been made for submission in our semester course in ANLP (Advanced Natural Language Processing),
although we didn't do anything too advanced eh!


## Getting Started

The files are divided into thus:

* Hate_speech_analysis.ipynb - the main ipython notebook
* BoGClassfier.py - the python function file for implementation of SVM and Naive Bayes on Bag of Words.
* common_functions.py - the python function file for implementation of common functionalities through out the notebook.
* FINALtweets_withLabels.pkl - the pickled file containing the dataset
* HAL_RF_functions.py -  the python function file for implementation of Random Forest on a modified form of HAL.
* hate_library.py - the libraries necessary all in all.


## Prerequisites

All of the below libraries are necessary:

* pickle
* re
* numpy
* matplotlib
* nltk
* sklearn
* tweepy
* io
* json
* operator
* pandas
* sklearn
* time
* codecs
* pprint


## Running the tests
All one has to do is get the libraries installed, download the notebook and all the associated files and run the notebook.
#### PS: there are three live graphs for static data, to show the slow build-up, they can be stopped by interrupting the kernel and one can continue normal opration there on running the other parts of the notebook

## Contribution
Special thanks to Prof. Tatjana Scheffler  for guiding us.
